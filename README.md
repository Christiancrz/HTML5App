# HTML5App
Base template for HTML5/CSS3 app using jQuery.   Update and go.   Client only.

This HTML5 App template is ES2017+ compliant, will run in all browsers natively without the need for any "compiler" or 3rd party pre-processing solution (Babel, Node, Broswerify, etc NOT required).

Modern browsers continue to evolve and extend the basic functionality and as of ES2017 full module suport, class (style) based inheritance, scoping are all available to make it easy for non JavaScript programmers to get into JavaScript.

All of the traditional, functional traits of JavaScript are mantained but made easier to access as beginners and programmers coming from other languages.

Enjoy this base template.

P.S. If you are using this as part of an assignment and do not edit this file I will deduct marks.
